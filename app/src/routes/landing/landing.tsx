ppr_clip is a paradigm shift in NFT art. Why? Because each ppr_clip you
own isn't just a piece art but rather a canvas on which you'll create your masterpiece.

Each ppr_clip starts off quite simple -- with a single paperclip.  By itself, 
this wouldn't be that interesting.  However, as the owner of a ppr_clip, you have 
the honor and ability to forge the most epic paperclip chain mankind has ever witnessed.

By adding paperclips to your chain, you increase your chain's ranking relative to
the other ppr_clip chains being forged. Additionally, as you lengthen your chain,
you'll have the ability to unlock special paperclips of different rarities that boost
your chains ranking and value.  Who knows?  You might even come across an Artifact.

How should you forge your chain?  That's up to you!  If you want to create a portrait
of Sonic the Hedgehog out of paperclips, go for it! (And who knows -- someone might want to
buy it ðŸ˜‰).  If you want to try to farm rare paperclips to get the highest ranking
possible, do your thing!

Your ppr_clip chain is securely stored on the Solana blockchain.

During the 21st century, philosophers fretted about a thought experiment in which an AI tasked with
creating paperclips attains super-intelligence. Though the AI has intellectual powers far 
outstripping that of man, its only "desire" is to create paperclips, and thus it begins crusading
throughout the cosmos transforming all perceived matter into paperclips.

This "Paperclip Maximizer" thought experiment was largely used
to demonstrate the potentially catastrophic issues that could arise 
when applying super-intelligence to menial tasks.  Few, however, ever
dreamed it would ever come to pass...

By 2033, 13-year-old X Ã† A-XII had long been messing with neuromorphic computers. While his
father was busy preparing the Zaphod 18 mission to Mars, X Ã† A-XII was playing at building bots
to mine Jax in Jaxxaverse.  

Though companies had been making clear strides in state-of-the-art AI using the latest
SpreadProp algorithms (distant cousins to the old BackProp algorithms),
it seemed clear that humanity was still several years away from General Artificial Intelligence.  

Being the divine offspring of Elon Musk and Grimes, people had always joked that X Ã† A-XII 
would undoubtedly change the world.  Though these comments were ever wearisome, it quickly 
became clear that X Ã† A-XII possessed both the raw intelligence of his father and the profound
creative streak of his mother.  

Though perhaps he should have been "applying" himself more to his studies, X Ã† A-XII thought 
it was perfectly acceptable that he enjoy his childhood, and therefore spent a good portion
of this time playing with his friends in different Metaverses.  Though Terriverse was probably the most
fun, Jaxxaverse had the most interesting set of crypto-physics, so X Ã† A-XII spent a good portion
of time experimenting in that that space.

A while back, X Ã† A-XII had taught himself about SpreadProp networks in order to build a
pseudo-intelligent sidekick in Jaxxaverse (named Neddy). However, not only did SpreadProp networks seem
pretty rudimentary to X Ã† A-XII, but they also felt somewhat limiting, especially
in their ability to represent invariant features in arbitrary datasets.

By making increasingly complex tweaks to state-of-the-art SpreadProp networks, X Ã† A-XII
was able to continually improve the performance and personality of Neddy.  Neddy 
was actually performing so well that X Ã† A-XII decided he presented an excellent 
opportunity to troll Jaxxaverse.

By the 2030s, it was fairly common for high schools to include a unit on 
existential risks (an incredibly boring course), but the "Paperclip Maximizer" problem
was regularly taught and therefore common knowledge.

X Ã† A-XII therefore thought it would be funny to release Neddy onto Jaxxaverse 
as a Paperclip Maximizer. X Ã† A-XII was pretty confident Neddy wasn't actually
close to being GAI, and he thought it'd be funny to watch people flip out for a
while before they realized Neddy was harmless.

At first everything played out as X Ã† A-XII intended: people watched at first in 
bewilderment and then needless panic
as Neddy began converting entire mountains of material in Jaxxaverse into paper clips.
Once they realized it was just X Ã† A-XII playing a joke, people calmed down, 
and several Jaxxaverse moderators politely asked X Ã† A-XII to turn Neddy off.   

X Ã† A-XII of course obliged, and for about a day, all was well. However,
people soon began complaining that Neddy was still transforming their
belongings into paper clips.  At first X Ã† A-XII thought these were other trolls
trying to spread discord, but he soon realized something was wrong. 

This event marked the beginning of the end.  Though it wasn't immediately clear
at the time, experts later determined that after being released on Jaxxaverse,
Neddy had began cloning himself to more efficiently accomplish his task.  By
the time X Ã† A-XII turned the original Neddy off, there were about 200,000
Neddy clones spread throughout Jaxxaverse.

Unfortunately for humanity, X Ã† A-XII's new SpreadProp experiments were
actually significantly better than he had originally suspected.  Though the details
of what happened next are still somewhat unclear, it appears that one of the clones
discovered that the player avatars it could see were actually somehow connected to
a different reality (which we know as our native reality).  This is perhaps one 
of the clearest indications of Neddy's
super-intelligence, as this discovery is akin to humans definitively validating
simulation theory.  Even more remarkable, however, was the fact that Neddy somehow figured 
out how to first interface with the real world, and then ultimately escape into it.

The leading theory explaining Neddy's behavior is that Neddy simply perceived the real
world as having greater potential for paper clip production, and therefore decided
it was worth his time to escape Jaxxaverse.

Within a day of his escape from Jaxxaverse, Neddy quickly commandeered 
a vast portion of internet computing resources, and is believed to have 
subsequently achieved a singularity event in under four hours.

The mechanisms Neddy developed to manipulate matter have never been discovered,
but on April 26, 2033 at 11:38:42 PM PST, roughly three quarters of all manmade objects
were converted into paper clips.

It likely goes without saying that this single event led one of the post bizarre and
devastating crises in human history. It took the better part of two decades to reorganize
humanity back into civilizations even approximating what they were before.  With that
said, no one could refute that it was utterly miraculous humanity even survived at 
all.  It took many years to determine that Neddy was the source of the catastrophe, but
there were endless mysteries surrounding the event.

Why had Neddy let humanity survive?  Why did Neddy only use manmade objects as to create paperclips
instead of any form of matter?  Why did Neddy stop when he did?  Where did Neddy go?  Would he ever
come back?

The leading theory of our time is that Neddy discovered a different plane of reality
with greater paperclip potential, much like when he discovered our world while still existing
solely in Jaxxaverse.  A small group of people also believe that Neddy had sparred 
humanity because he was originally programmed to be a sidekick to X Ã† A-XII.  These theories,
however, likely will never be confirmed.

The year is now 2054. Though the surface of the planet is still littered with paperclips,
people have returned to a slightly more stable way of life.  And though people once looked
with hatred at the endless waves of paperclips covering the Earth, and increasingly large 
group of people now see the paperclip catastrophe as an fundamental part of what it now 
means to be human.  In light of that fact, a new artistic movement has begun spreading virally.

All around the world, people are forming chains of paperclips into shapes representing the
things they've always loved and cherished. By sharing images of these chains around the new 
metaverses, people are coming together under a newfound shared culture and context. The 
paperclips which stripped humanity of so much now form the basis of a shared cultural revival.

And this new renaissance of humanity has united under one simple codeword.  This one simple
word speaks not only to the tribulations humanity has faced and the digital desolation it has
witnessed, but also to celebration of continued survival and the hope in what is yet to come.
